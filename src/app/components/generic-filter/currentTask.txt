This component should be a reusable one.
This component should not do any sorting/filtering at all - it should only emit sort or filter data.
It should emit on every change.
Eg.
- If the user selects to sort by title, the component can emit an object of type SortData that has 'field' and 'direction' { field: 'title', direction: 'asc' }

Sorting by = a dropdown with options:

Start date
Join deadline
Title
Fee

Default sort selected: Start Date ascending

Filter by = 3 filtering sections:

Period –  Start date cannot be > End date
Category – If none selected, all displayed
Hide – If none selected, all displayed

Default filters: Start Date – present day

There should also be a "Filter" button somewhere on the bottom right side that would trigger the filter emitter.
The component should have an Input() allowing to make the 'Hide' section not visible.
